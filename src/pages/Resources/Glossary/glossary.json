This aggressive approach to acquisition often involves the bidding company making a direct offer to the target company's shareholders or attempting to replace its board of directors to gain control. Hostile takeovers are typically executed through a tender offer, where the acquiring company offers to buy shares from shareholders at a premium to the current market price, or a proxy fight, where the acquiring company persuades shareholders to vote out the existing management in favor of a new board that will approve the takeover. Hostile takeovers can lead to significant changes in the management and strategic direction of the acquired company and are often contentious, with the target company employing various defense strategies, such as poison pills or golden parachutes, to resist the takeover.

        "Description": "A Zero-Based Contract is a contract management approach where each new contract period starts from a zero base, without reference to previous periods. Instead of using past budgets or spending as a starting point, all expenses must be justified for each new period. This method ensures that resources are allocated based on current needs and priorities rather than historical expenditures. Zero-based contracts are used to promote efficiency and cost-effectiveness by scrutinizing all expenses and eliminating unnecessary costs. This approach is particularly useful in budgeting and financial planning, driving more strategic and rational decision-making."
