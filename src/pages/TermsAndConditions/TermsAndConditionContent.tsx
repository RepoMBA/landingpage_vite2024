        <h2 className="font-bold mt-[30px]">3. Your Account Terms</h2>
        <p className="my-[30px]">
          You may not access the Onitt/Legitt Services through automated methods, such as the use of robots or other computer code which calls the Services, except where we have given you express written permission.
        </p>
        <p className="my-[30px]">
          Each user must provide a valid email address and any other information requested in order to fully complete the signup process and create a login. You may only create a separate login for as many Users as your current Onitt/Legitt Plan allows. The sharing of your Legitt Account login credentials is strictly prohibited. You are responsible for maintaining the security of each User’s account, username and password and for ensuring that each User associated with your Legitt Account complies with these Terms.
        </p>
        <p className="my-[30px]">
          Legitt is not liable for any loss or damage from your (or your Users’) failure to comply with these Terms. You are solely responsible for all Data posted to your account, whether or not you personally posted the Data.
        </p>
        <h2 className="font-bold mt-[30px]">4. Forms & Submissions</h2>
        <p className="my-[30px]">
          Legitt does not claim ownership of any information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages, tags, or other materials you use, gather, submit, or make available to others through the use of the Onitt/Legitt Services (“Forms and Submissions”). As between Onitt/Legitt and you, you own all rights to your Forms and Submissions. When you make a Form, Submissions page, or Report “public”, you grant Onitt/Legitt a worldwide and fully sublicensable license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, publicly perform, and publicly display your Forms and Submissions (in whole or in part) in any format or medium now known or later developed. Submissions and Reports will only be made public with your permission. Forms are public by default but of course, if you choose the private setting for your forms, they won’t be made public. Onitt/Legitt does not pre-screen forms or submissions and you agree that you are solely responsible for all of your Forms and User Submissions.
        </p>
        <h2 className="font-bold mt-[30px]">5. Payments, Renewals, Credit Card Details, Downgrades, Refunds</h2>
        <p className="my-[30px]">
          <b>Payments.</b> All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, except for sales taxes as we may be required to add under local law. You shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, and duties, including any sale or value-added taxes and similar taxes and duties imposed by any governing authority in any jurisdiction in connection with your use of the Onitt/Legitt Services.
        </p>
        <p className="my-[30px]">
          Onitt/Legitt offers payments through third-party payment processors. By making payments to us for Onitt/Legitt services, you indicate that you have reviewed the Terms of Services and privacy policy of the payment processor for the country in which you are located and agree to both.
        </p>
        <p className="my-[30px]">
          <b>Automatic Renewal.</b> Paid accounts are subscriptions. This means that you will be billed in advance on a recurring, periodic basis. Your Onitt/Legitt subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle until you cancel your Onitt/Legitt subscription. If you downgrade, your account will remain at your current plan through the end of your current billing cycle.
        </p>
        <p className="my-[30px]">
          <b>Credit card details.</b> If you have elected to pay the fees for a Onitt/Legitt subscription by credit card, you warrant that the credit card information you provide is correct and that you will promptly notify us of any changes to such credit card information. You agree that if your credit card payment cannot be processed for any reason, Onitt/Legitt may suspend or cancel your Onitt/Legitt subscription.
        </p>
        <p className="my-[30px]">
          <b>Downgrades.</b> Downgrading your Onitt/Legitt account plan may cause the loss of features or capacity of your account. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Onitt/Legitt does not accept any liability for such losses. Downgrading your subscription will not cause you to lose your forms or your data.
        </p>
        <p className="my-[30px]">
          <b>Cancellation.</b> Paid plans are subscriptions that auto-renew by default. You can cancel auto-renew at any time to cancel your subscription. To cancel your Onitt/Legitt subscription at any time, go to the Billing section of your account, and downgrade your account to the free Starter plan. If you’re logged into your account, you can simply click Downgrade below the Starter option on the pricing page. You can delete your account entirely by clicking Delete My Account on your Account Settings page. Cancelling auto-renew prevents your payment method from being charged at your next billing date, or if you pay by invoice, prevents your next invoice from being issued. Your current subscription (the time you already paid for) isn’t affected, so you’ll continue to be able to access and benefit from paid features until the plan downgrades on your next billing date.
        </p>
        <p className="my-[30px]">
          <b>30 Day Money Back Policy.</b> If for any reason you decide to cancel your account within 30 days of your payment, you will be issued a refund for the full amount.
        </p>
        <h2 className="font-bold mt-[30px]">6. Onitt's Use of Data</h2>
        <p className="my-[30px]">
          You hereby authorize us to access, use and display Data for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide the Services to you, to protect the Data, and to protect our online or computer resources from unlawful cyberattacks. We will not modify any Data, copy Data onto any media, disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer all or any part of the Data, or use, duplicate, transfer, sell, distribute or otherwise disclose the Data to any other party.
        </p>

        <p className="my-[30px]">
          You shall not use or display the Onitt/Legitt trademark or logo of the other party without our written permission. This section shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement.
        </p>
        <h2 className="font-bold mt-[30px]">8. Terms and Termination</h2>
        <p className="my-[30px]">

        <h2 className="font-bold mt-[30px]">9. Warranties</h2>
        <p className="my-[30px]">
          Mutual Warranty. Each party warrants to the other party that it has the legal power and authority to enter into this Agreement and that the person signing for that party has the authority to bind that party to the terms of this Agreement.

        <p className="my-[30px]">
          You agree that you will defend Onitt/Legitt against claims or proceedings alleging that Data or our transmission or hosting thereof infringes or violates the rights of a third party or violates data privacy or protection laws, and you agree to indemnify Onitt/Legitt against damages and costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction or in a settlement of the claim approved in writing by you.
